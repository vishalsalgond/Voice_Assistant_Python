This is a simple Voice Assistant made in Python using [Google's text-to-speech (gTTS) module](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/). Note that this assistant does not use any machine learning.

## These are some of the things the assistant can do -
- Open desktop applications like MS Word, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint, Google Chrome, Firefox etc.
- Open websites like Google, Facebook, Gmail, YouTube in Firefox browser.
- Show events on your Google Calender. You do not have to specifically mention the date, the assistant will figure it out from your query ;)
- Show recent/trending news. It will also read out all those news items.
- Make a note in notepad and save the file.
- Search something on google.
